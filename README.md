<h1 align=center>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm Vitor, a Brazilian committed to applying innovative technologies to old problems (this is very paradoxical :sweat_smile:). For that, I started my graduation on Information Systems at [USP](https://www5.usp.br/) since 2020.

### About Me :eyes:
* :rocket: Experience in the development environment since 2020
* :books: I am currently learning about web development
* :muscle: I've been reinforcing my knowledge of data structure and time and space complexity 
* :thinking: Iâ€™m looking for help with backend
* :thought_balloon: Talk to me about innovations
